# Minecraft PS3 World Region Conversion Guide

## Simple Concept
Today, we'll replace the GAMEDATA file of a Minecraft PS3 world to convert its region. For example, we can take the GAMEDATA file of an NPUB world and paste it into a BLES world. This converts the NPUB world to the BLES world. Placing the BLES world on the PS3 system will then contain the contents of the original NPUB world.

## Requirements

- Minecraft PS3 world saved onto a USB for both source (e.g., NPUB) and destination (e.g., BLES) regions.
- USB drive
- Device with a USB port (such as a PC, laptop, Chromebook.)
- Optional: Internet connection to download world folders from websites or platforms like Discord. If you download the world folder, ensure to extract it if it is in a compressed format such as .zip, .7z, or .rar.

## Guide

1. **Prepare both Minecraft Worlds:**
   - Ensure you have a Minecraft PS3 world saved onto a USB for **both** regions. Obtain world folders from the PS3 system or from the internet or platforms like Discord. (If downloaded, extract if in a compressed format.)

2. **Connect the USB Drive:**
   - Plug the USB drive into a compatible device like a PC, laptop, or Chromebook.

3. **Locate Original World:**
   - Open the folder containing the world you want to convert. Locate the "GAMEDATA" file.

4. **Copy the GAMEDATA File:**
   - Copy the "GAMEDATA" file from the original world.
   - **For example**: If I wanted to convert an NPUB world to BLEs, in this step I would open the NPUB world's folder and copy its GAMEDATA file.

5. **Paste into Destination World:**
   - Navigate to the folder of the destination world on the USB drive (new region).
   - Paste the "GAMEDATA" file, replacing the existing one for that region.
   - **For example**: If I wanted to convert an NPUB world to BLEs, in this step I would paste the NPUB world's GAMEDATA file into the BLES world's folder and replace the GAMEDATA file that the folder already has in it from the BLES world.

6. **Finalize:**
   - Safely eject the USB drive.
   - Plug the USB back into the PS3 system.
   - Copy the world onto the system through the PS3 XMB menu (the home screen.)
   - Open the region of Minecraft that we converted the world for and test out the world (the converted world should be all the way at the top of the list.)

**Important Notes:**
- This guide assumes the structure of the world files remains consistent across different regions. It's crucial to have backups before proceeding.

**Disclaimer:**
- I am not responsible for any damage.
- Back up the world folders before proceeding.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If the game can't read the converted world, consider replacing "GAMEDATA" using a tool like the "Universal Minecraft Editor." Such tools often provide an option to replace the "GAMEDATA" file when opening a world.

**Conversion Process:**
- Copy the "GAMEDATA" from the original world, replacing the "GAMEDATA" file in the destination world folder for the desired region.
